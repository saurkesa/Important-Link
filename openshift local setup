  ===========================================================
CRC stands for CodeReady Containers, which is a tool provided by Red Hat to help developers run a local OpenShift cluster on their personal machines.
It’s primarily designed for developers who want to test, experiment, and develop applications for OpenShift without needing a full-fledged OpenShift 
cluster hosted in the cloud or on-premises.

A pull secret is basically a JSON file that contains credentials used to authenticate against Red Hat’s container image registry (registry.redhat.io).
OpenShift uses this registry to pull the official Red Hat container images (like the cluster components, operators, and more). Without the pull secret,
OpenShift won’t be able to download these images.
